<p>Hello Friend at <%= @email%> ,</p>
<p>
  You showed some interest in our Salaree.com project earlier, so we're happy to inform that Salaree <a href="http://sa;aree.com">salaree.com</a> is now launched!
</p>
<p>
  Salaree.com is currently in beta (so it's absolutely free to use while in beta!). We'd love for you to <a href="http://signup.salaree.com">sign up</a> and check out the application, upload some data
  and perhaps do a salary run too? The most commonly used modules (called Calculators in our parlance) are available and you just have to pick and choose the one you need.
</p>
<p>
  You can download our sample Employee Upload excel file, fill up the details of your employees and get started ASAP. Check it all out in the Video after you log in.
  Making it easy to use has been our top priority so your feedback would be vital for us, and you can do that by clicking the feedback button and letting us know your thoughts.
</p>
<p>We're here to help!</p>
<div>Regards,</div>
<div>Aditya Sanghi,</div>
